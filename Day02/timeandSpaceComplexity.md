# time-complexity->
- it is a time taken by an algorithm to complete its execution.

# space-complexity-> 
- it is the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to complete its execution.

## BigO -> worst case time complexity
- It represents the upper bound of the time taken by an algorithm to complete its execution.
- Equations used to represent time complexity: 
  - O(1) -> constant time complexity
  - O(log n) -> logarithmic time complexity
  - O(n) -> linear time complexity
  - O(n log n) -> linearithmic time complexity
  - O(n^2) -> quadratic time complexity
  - O(2^n) -> exponential time complexity
  - O(n!) -> factorial time complexity

- **f(n) = O(g(n))** -> f(n) is upper bounded by g(n) for sufficiently large n.
- Example: 
  - for loop -> O(n)
  - nested for loop -> O(n^2)
  - binary search -> O(log n)
